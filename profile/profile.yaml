summary: I am a graduate of Humber College with a Post Graduate Degree in Information Technology Solutions. During my
  program, I worked on several projects as a group and individually with several tech stacks. I had the
  opportunity to work with a financial services company as a full stack developer focused on MERN stack technologies and
  collaborated with team members to build a SaaS software. I was responsible for writing several Rest APIs and
  implementing APIs on the front-end. From my experience, I have demonstrated problem-solving skills
  and implemented optimized solutions to challenges. I am a Developer at Jarvis where i'm tasked on challenging
  projects to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge. In my spare time, I like to read books and learn new things. I am looking to challenge myself and interested in positions where I can implement my creativity to solve
  problems.
