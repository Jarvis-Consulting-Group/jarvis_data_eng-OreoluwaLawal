# Oreoluwa Lawal . Jarvis Consulting

I am a graduate of Humber College with a Post Graduate Degree in Information Technology Solutions. During my program, I worked on several projects as a group and individually with several tech stacks. I had the opportunity to work with a financial services company as a full stack developer focused on MERN stack technologies and collaborated with team members to build a SaaS software. I was responsible for writing several Rest APIs and implementing APIs on the front-end. From my experience, I have demonstrated problem-solving skills and implemented optimized solutions to challenges. I am a Developer at Jarvis where i'm tasked on challenging projects to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge. In my spare time, I like to read books and learn new things. I am looking to challenge myself and interested in positions where I can implement my creativity to solve problems.
